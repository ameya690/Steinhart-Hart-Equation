# Steinhart-Hart-Equation
The Steinhart-Hart-Equation is an equation mainly used for deriving a precise temperature of a thermistor, since it provides a closer approximation to actual temperature than simpler equations, and is useful over the entire working temperature range of the sensor.
<p>This code was used for implementing this equation for reading thermistor values in realtime plot window from a PhyCom circuit board developed at the CEDT Lab at NSUT, Delhi.</p>
